# Parse Todo App

A simple Todo App created in Flutter with Parse as the backend, demonstrating CRUD operations. 

The objective of this repo is to provide a starter example for developers opting for Parse as backend and Flutter as frontend, and without using any third party libraries anyone can build the app using RESTful APIs provided by The Brewery - Craft.

## Getting Started

1. Go to your Craft application's Settings page.
2. Edit `./lib/constants.dart` and copy the needed credentials. 

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
